      <h2>About the site</h2>
      <p>This site is a place to read recommendations for new books you might want to read! All recommendations are written by Gretchen Bonnes.
        She has only written recommendations on this site for books that she highly recommends! Browse the home page
         to see all the books that are reviewed on this 
        site. Click "Read More" on each book to navigate to the full recommendation. The title on the top left of the screen, "Gretchen's Book Recs",
         will always act as a homepage 
        button. Click on it if you ever want to navigate back to the home screen. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        The "Random Rec" button will eventually take you to - you guessed it - a random recommendation! But for now it takes you back to the home page.
         If you see a book title that you recognize, you
        can start by reading that recommendation, or you can pick one you haven't heard of! You never know what recommendation might pique your interest. 
        Each review should take about 2 minutes to read.
        Read one or read them all - either way - we hope this website helps you enjoy more great books!
